        // Question : elem.innerHTML is used to populate a div with HTML. search online about this method and create a website with a div tag containing a random joke given an array of jokes.

        let b = Math.floor(Math.random() * (a.length - 1)) + 1

        let s = a[b]
        console.log(a[b])
